## Usage

Just hit the command below at the root of your CDK project.
```bash
npx cdk-lambda-log
```

## HighLights
- :white_check_mark: Fetch and follow the latest log stream of a single Lambda function
- :white_check_mark: Switch log stream automatically when cold start or new version of lambda is deployed
- :white_check_mark: You do not need to specify complex Lambda function names automatically generated by CDK

## Options

You can specify the stack name. If you do so, `cdk-lambda-log` try to search Lambda functions created by the stack.
```bash
npx cdk-lambda-log --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME
```

You can specify the function name. If you do so, `cdk-lambda-log` try to fetch the latest logs from Amazon CloudWatch.
```bash
npx cdk-lambda-log --function-name YOUR_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME
```

## Note
`cdk-lambda-log` is developed for use in debugging during development.
As such, it only displays logs from the most recent log stream.
If you want to view multiple log streams in a production environment, you can use `cdk watch` or `sam logs`.
